## Experiments with the Cavium Octeon II eval board

This repo holds some code I'm using to explore the EEB68 that Cavium kindly provided to UW CSE.

It's made to be dropped into the Octeon SDK at

```
OCTEON-SDK/examples/cavium-experiments
```

As in the provided examples, ```make``` will build the binary, and ```make run``` will run it on the simulator. This requires having the SDK with the simulator.
